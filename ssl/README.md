## Objectives
Practice core Active Directory tasks commonly handled by Tier 1 Help Desk technicians.

## Tasks Completed

- Created a domain user (`jdoe`) within the Staff OU
- Verified domain authentication by logging into CLIENT01
- Reset a domain user password with forced password change at next logon
- Disabled and re-enabled a domain user account

## Outcome
Confirmed proper Active Directory user lifecycle management and domain authentication
between a Windows Server domain controller and a Windows client.

## Screenshots
Screenshots are included at key proof points to verify hands-on execution of tasks,
including OU structure, user account actions, and domain authentication.
