# SSL Day 4 – Permissions & File Shares

## Objectives
Understand and configure Windows file sharing using both share permissions and
NTFS permissions, and verify effective access from a domain user.

## Tasks Completed
- Created a shared folder on the domain controller
- Configured share permissions to allow read-only access for Domain Users
- Configured NTFS permissions to enforce least-privilege access
- Tested successful access to the share from a domain-joined client
- Verified that write access was correctly denied

## Outcome
Confirmed that domain users can access shared resources according to configured
permissions and that Windows correctly enforces access restrictions.

## Screenshots
Screenshots are included at key proof points to demonstrate share configuration,
NTFS permissions, successful access testing, and enforced access denial.
