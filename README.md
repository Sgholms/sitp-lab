# SITP Lab (Shane’s IT Platform)

This repository documents my hands-on IT home lab focused on Help Desk and junior sysadmin skills.

## Contents
- `/ssl` – Structured day-by-day Help Desk lab (Windows + Active Directory + troubleshooting)
- `/docs` – Standards and configurations (rules/scope, BitLocker)

## Highlights
- Active Directory user lifecycle (OUs, user creation, password reset, disable/enable)
- Domain authentication verification on a Windows client
- Proof-point screenshots only (clean, recruiter-friendly)
